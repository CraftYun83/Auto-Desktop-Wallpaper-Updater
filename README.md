# Desktop-Wallpaper-Automator
Automatically finds a wallpaper for your desktop according to the time of the day.

I do not give a shit what you do with my code.

You will need to have a Pexels API key

You can get one by signing up for a pexels account and then creating a new project here https://www.pexels.com/api/new/.

Then update the variable inside the variable called "APIKEY" inside the Python script.

You will need to create a directory called "Image" in the same directory as the script.

Dependencies:

`screeninfo`
